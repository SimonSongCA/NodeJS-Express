# NodeJS-Express

We're using this folder structure for the sake of familiarity: it's a conventional Express structure.

A tool called 'express-generator' generates this structure with some other additions.

We'll use the generator in the next chapter, for now we're concentrating on the bare bones to create the equivalent of our minimum viable web server that we implemented in the previous section.

Use 'npm start' to start the local service
